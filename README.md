# **OVERSEER-Ω**

**OVERSEER-Ω** is a bot I made to moderate the comment section of my Telegram channel. You can find it via [@OVERSEER_OMEGA_BOT](https://t.me/OVERSEER_OMEGA_BOT).

It mainly functions as a **moderator**, but you can tinker with it to change its behavior to your liking. The current prompt provided is very simple. Also, you'll need an **API key**, which you can get from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) if you wish to change it.

## **How to Set Up**

After creating a bot:

1. **Maximize its capabilities in groups** and enable adding it to any Telegram group.
2. Then you'll have it set up.

---

## **Current Functionality**

The provided functionality is quite limited up until now:

- The bot **reads each message**, and if it detects any **toxicity**, it issues a **permanent mute** on the violating user and replies with a random proper error message.

---

## **Random Chance Features**

The bot also has a **0.07% chance** to either:

- Reply to a newly sent message, reminding a user that they are being watched,  
- Or make an announcement for all users (**each 0.035% chance**).

You can, of course, change these as well. All of these were added only to make the bot **spookier** and serve no useful purpose.

## **Bot Model**

**OVERSEER-Ω** uses **microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct**, which is a **very simple language model**. Since I'm broke and can't afford to pay for an API, this is all I could get. To run it effectively, you would need to use **GPUs**.

---

## **System Setup**

The functionality to run it on your **local system** is provided in the code, though not guaranteed. 

- I personally run it on **Google Colab’s GPUs**. 
- However, do note that every session it has to download about **7GB** before running, which I'm sure has a fix that I'm unaware of.

---

## **Customization**

You can easily use **any model you wish** by making adjustments to the code.

---

## **Future Functionality**

There are **many functionalities** to be added to **OVERSEER-Ω**, like:

- Issuing warnings before banning  
- Interacting with users

All of which can be added, and I plan to add myself.

---

## **Improving Performance**

The current model's performance can be upgraded by:

- Providing it with examples of "OK" and "NOT OK" messages for it to learn.  
- Providing a **more comprehensive prompt**.

---

## **Updates**

I will update the bot as time passes by.
